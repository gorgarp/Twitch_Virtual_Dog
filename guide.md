# Twitch Dog Bot User Guide

Welcome to the Twitch Dog Bot! This guide will help you understand how to interact with your virtual dog on Twitch. Follow the instructions below to get started and learn about all the fun commands you can use.

## Getting Started

### Adopting a Dog

To adopt your first dog, use the `!adopt` command. This command is free and will give you a randomly generated dog with a unique origin story.

```
!adopt
```

### Naming Your Dog

You can name or rename your dog using the `!name` command followed by the new name you want to give your dog.

```
!name <new_name>
```
Example:
```
!name Buddy
```

### Checking Your Dog's Status

To check your dog's status, including their name, breed, level, XP, and origin story, use the `!status` command.

```
!status
```

## Checking Bones

To check how many bones you have, use the `!bones` command.

```
!bones
```

### Getting a New Origin Story

If you want a new origin story for your dog, use the `!newstory` command to generate a new one.

```
!newstory
```

## Interacting with Your Dog

### Basic Interactions

You can interact with your dog using the following commands. Each interaction costs bones (the in-chat currency) and rewards XP. The cost and XP gained vary depending on the interaction.

- `!pet`
- `!walk`
- `!treat`
- `!snuggle`
- `!play`

Example:
```
!pet
```

### Playing Fetch

You can play fetch with your dog using the `!fetch` command. This command has a chance to reward both XP and bones.

```
!fetch
```

## Leveling Up

As your dog earns XP, they will level up and evolve into different breeds. The bot will notify you when your dog levels up and evolves.

## Teaching Tricks

### Training New Tricks

Teach your dog new tricks using the `!train` command. If your dog already knows all the tricks, the bot will inform you.

```
!train
```

### Performing Tricks

Have your dog perform a random trick using the `!trick` command. Successfully performing a trick will reward your dog with XP.

```
!trick
```

## Daily Login Bonus

You will receive a daily bonus of bones for logging in and chatting each day. The amount increases with consecutive daily logins, up to a maximum of 30 days. The bot will notify you of your daily bonus and streak.

## Special Events

### Random Events

Every 15-20 minutes, random events may occur where your dog interacts with other users' dogs. These events reward both dogs with XP.

## Leaderboard

Check the top 10 dogs by level and XP using the `!leaderboard` command. The leaderboard shows the dog's name, owner's username, level, and XP.

```
!leaderboard
```

## Help Command

For a quick link to this guide, use the `!help` command.

```
!help
```

## Moderation

### Blacklisting Users

Moderators can use the `!nodog` command to remove a user's dog and blacklist the user from adopting another dog.

```
!nodog @<username>
```
Example:
```
!nodog @troublesomeuser
```

Thank you for using the Twitch Dog Bot! Have fun interacting with your virtual dogs and watching them grow and evolve.
